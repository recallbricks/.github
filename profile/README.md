## ⭐ What is RecallBricks?

Traditional vector databases return "similar" results. RecallBricks returns context:

- **Relationships** - What connects to what
- **Causality** - What caused what  
- **Patterns** - What matters
- **Context** - The full story, not just keywords

Built for AI agents, coding assistants, and intelligent applications.
